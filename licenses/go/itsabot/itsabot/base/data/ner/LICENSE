INTRODUCTION
------------

The UKACD is a word list compiled for the crossword community.

In particular, it's intended for setters and solvers of
advanced cryptic crosswords in the UK; for example, the
Listener Crossword and the barred puzzles in the Sunday
broadsheets.

Although there are many word lists in the public domain, none
is well suited for use with crossword construction and word
search software.

This freely distributable list should be more helpful, as it
is specifically intended for use with crossword software. The
list will be updated at periodic intervals to correct errors
and make additions.

The UKACD is in the ISO 8859-1 character set (compatible with
the Windows ANSI character set), with a single entry per line.

EDITORIAL POLICY
----------------

The original basis for the UKACD was a word list of some
500,000 entries, compiled from public domain sources.

This was reduced to a list of around 190,000 words by
eliminating entries that aren't generally allowable in
UK advanced cryptic puzzles.

The list continues to be improved as missing entries are
discovered and added. A new update is issued when several
thousand entries have been added since the previous one.

The vocabulary included in the following single volume UK
English dictionaries is used as a guide to acceptability:

The Chambers Dictionary
Collins English Dictionary
The Concise Oxford Dictionary

Words are given in all their inflected forms, where
appropriate. That is, nouns are given in their plural
form(s); verbs are given as the infinitive, third person
singular, present and past participle; and the comparative
and superlative forms of adjectives are included where
they are reasonably common.

Common proper names are included, as they are often found
in crosswords, even though only Collins of the above
dictionaries has a systematic coverage of them. Some very
common words not to be found in any of the dictionaries
are also included.

To make the list more useful for compiling jumbo grids,
longer non-dictionary entries are being added. These include:
well-known quotations and proverbs; fictional characters and
book titles; films, pieces of music and works of art.

Some attempt is made to standardise the punctuation and
capitalisation of entries; in particular, by ensuring all
proper names start with a capital letter. However, no great
effort is put into this, as it only marginally affects the
usefulness of the list to crossworders.

Dictionary entries only differing in punctuation, accenting or
capitalisation are folded onto the single most common form.
This is done to save space and, again makes little difference
to the value of the UKACD to setters and solvers.

FEEDBACK
--------

If you find any errors, or have suggestions for additions,
please e-mail or post them to me at the address on the first
page of this document. Provided they are within the scope of
the UKACD, as defined under EDITORIAL POLICY, they will be
included in the next release of the word list.
