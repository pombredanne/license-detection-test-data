Note that the cowsay concept and original implementation is by Tony Monroe <tony@nog.net>

The default cowfiles bundled with this cowsay are from https://github.com/schacon/cowsay.

Additional cowfiles which may be included as cowjars are from other open source projects 
and are referenced in the relevant cowjar directories.
