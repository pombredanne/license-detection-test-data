OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,

-------------------------------------

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above 
cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts 
shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all 
civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or 
assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.
